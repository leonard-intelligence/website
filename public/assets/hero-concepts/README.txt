# Hero Slider Instructions

1. Place your test images in this folder (`public/assets/hero-concepts`).
2. Name them sequentially: `hero 1.jpg`, `hero 2.png`, `hero 3.webp`, etc.
3. Go to the website Hero section.
4. Hover over the left or right side of the hero section to see the arrows (or they might be visible if I made them always visible on hover).
5. Click the arrows to cycle through your images.
6. `Hero 0` is the default original image.
